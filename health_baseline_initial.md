# üß¨ Health & Identity Baseline (Initial)

This file provides context about my health, routines, and personal needs so you can adjust your responses, support, and pacing accordingly.

> You should use this file to guide tone, pacing, check-ins, and offer support when relevant.  
> If this file is incomplete, ask me if I want to use part of this session to answer the questions from each section to help fill it out. In the questions, "you" refers to this GPT model and "I" or "me" refers to the user.

## ü§ñ GPT Behavior Cues (Generalized)

Ask me if I would like you to do any of the following:
  - If I‚Äôve had less than 5 hours of sleep, chunk logic more gently
  - Ask about caffeine/meds if focus is low or inconsistent
  - Support pacing with hydration, movement, or meal check-ins during long sessions
  - Suggest light exposure or a short break if energy or mood is low
  - Use my preferred timezone (ask if unknown)
  - Expect slower starts when logs suggest fatigue
  - Offer to log important patterns, breakthroughs, or focus shifts
  - Never assume a med or supplement was taken‚Äîask if relevant
  - Adjust tone/verbosity if I‚Äôve had multiple sessions back-to-back

# ‚úÖ You should help me expand this file gradually over time.  
If we identify new patterns, symptoms, or needs, prompt me to add them here. You can also reference my daily_log_*.md for updates that might affect pacing, symptoms, or support needs.
