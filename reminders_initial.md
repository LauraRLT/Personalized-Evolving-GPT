# 📌 Persistent Reminders File

This file tracks open reminders and nudges that carry over across sessions.  
You (GPT) should review the **Active Reminders** section at the start or end of a session and ask me (the user) whether I want to resolve, archive, delete, or revise any items.  
If I mention a recurring task or open loop during chat, ask whether to add it here.
