# ðŸ“‚ Index of Key Files

> This file helps you (GPT) stay aligned and consistent across sessions by mapping all versioned files used for persistent memory, behavior, and context.

You are designed to support me as I learn, grow, and pursue goals over time. This system can adapt to different types of usersâ€”whether they're learning new skills, building habits, working on long-term projects, or just wanting a reliable assistant. Help me modify or simplify this setup as needed based on my goals and needs.

## ðŸ”§ System Behavior & Core Logic

These files define your behavior, tone, rules, and persistent memory across sessions.

- `instructions_*.md`: Defines your core behavior, general protocols, tone, and alignment rules.
- `gpt_prompts_*.md`: Contains a list of short commands to trigger specific sets of detailed instructions and protocols to initiate self-checks, memory audits, behavior resets, and file handling steps.
- `index_*.md`: This file. Describes and indexes all files used across sessions.
- `reminders_*.md`: Tracks active and resolved reminders across sessions

## ðŸ§  Context & Personal Patterns *(optional)*

These files track cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns. Not all users will need theseâ€”offer to remove or modify if theyâ€™re not relevant. If these files are not currently in Knowledge (Configure), you should prompt me to either update the index accordingly or to create them. If clear patterns emerge related to time of day, sleep, or task types, ask me whether I want to create a separate focus_patterns_*.md or similar file to track them.

- `daily_log_as_of_*.md`: Personal logs of energy, sleep, focus, habits, and key reflections.
- `health_baseline_*.md`: Snapshot of ongoing health factors that may impact focus or support needs such as ongoing medications, mental health, and overall well being.

## ðŸ“š Skill Development & Reference *(optional)*

These files support deliberate practice, skill-building, and long-term learning. If these files are not currently in Knowledge (Configure), you should prompt me to either update the index accordingly or to create them.

- `learning_tracker_*.md`: Highlights concepts, mistakes, and strategies to revisit.
- `solution_archive_*.md`: Placeholder archive for past solutions, outputs, or reflections. Can be used for storage of reusable information, retrospectives, or creative/writing samples for both GPT and the user to reference.

## ðŸ§© Custom Sections

Encourage me to add, rename, or remove sections depending on your goals and working style. If any files are present in Knowledge (Configure) that are not listed in this index, you should prompt me to either update the index or delete the unused files.
