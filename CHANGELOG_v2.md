# üìì CHANGELOG

## Version 2.0 ‚Äì March 28, 2025

This release is a major overhaul of the personalized GPT system, built for long-term support, modularity, and adaptability across learning goals and support needs. New layouts were applied to many of the files and templates were added where necessary. Many files now include prompts to guide both the user and GPT through initial setup and customization.
Designed to make the system more flexible, scalable by GPT, and accessible to new users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Changes

- **Time handling clarified**: Filenames use UTC timestamps, while all content within files should follow the user's local timezone if provided
- **Tone generalized** to support users in any domain, not just coding or neurodivergent contexts
- **Improved structure and formatting** in all files for GPT readability and future customization

---

## üìÇ File-by-File Changes

### `README.md`
- Rewritten and expanded based on changes to files

### `instructions_*.md`
- Fully restructured and modularized into clearly labeled sections
- Refined tone for GPT-wide behavior, pacing, transparency, and energy awareness
- Prompts to guide user and GPT through initial setup were added

### `health_baseline_*.md` *(new file in v2)*
- Provides a template for storing medical, mental health, sleep, and energy patterns
- Structured as a collaborative intake between GPT and user
- Optional and flexible ‚Äî designed to support neurodivergence, executive function, or pacing needs

---

### `Text_for_Prompt_Box.md`
- Updated to match v2 file structure and timestamp behavior
- Clearer instructions for file loading, syncing, and scope across sessions
- GPT onboarding instructions rewritten for clarity
